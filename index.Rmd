This website is designed to list and define the guidelines for
[_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) Working Groups and
Committees. Working groups have specific short term goals / deliverables they
work toward and then disband. Committees have long-term standing to provide
strategic guidance or continued support and structure.
