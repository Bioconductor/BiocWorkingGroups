## Package Review

- Description: The package review working group was established to review and
revise the current review process for Bioconductor. It also was tasked with
updating Bioconductor package guidelines and package submission
documentation. Its current focus is to update, clean up, and reorganize the
material presented at http://contributions.bioconductor.org/. This is <b>not</b> the
group to volunteer to become a Bioconductor package reviewer. This group is to
refine the requirements for a Bioconductor package.

## Publication

- Description: Publication discussion with F1000R and other venues that enable publication of workflows, BioC material from workshops or package presentations. This working group is trying to make it easier and less expensive to publish papers on BioC advances that can be kept up to date while still providing DOI and valid publication metadata so that there is a citation and recognition mechanism. Highly interested in new Overlay publishing and using quarto for new publication models.
